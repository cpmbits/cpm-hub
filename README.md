# CPM Hub Plugin Repository
CPM is a generic manager for C and C++ projects. The Plugin Repository is the backend that contains
the package index. You can even download and create your own installation of the CPM Hub Plugin Repository
for keeping your proprietary code out of sight. Using CPM, you'll be able to target multiple repositories.
